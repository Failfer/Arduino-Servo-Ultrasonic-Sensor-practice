The goal of this project for me is to notably improve my robotics skills in power managment, complex circuits, material aquisition, and general skills that are gained from doing. 

I intend to have multiple versions of this bot. I'll make seperate branches for each design. My first is using only an ultrasonic sensor since I have one for nativation. Then likely a bump sensor system for navigation. Then likley a hybrid. The goal is 
to make this for notably less than buying one even if mine is notably lesser quality. A mostly functional one is a major success. 

I think i'll make a square design instead of a circle design Vac Bot. The main fundementals should remain though. 

For algorithims I'll start with a simple rotate randomly when collision occour and then likley move towards a SLAM like system if I get that far. 

While I think this is beyond scope it would be good to have a system for it to return to a charging station when its low on battery.

We shouldn't have to worry about the things we purchuse spying on us. Privacy and true consent is a right even if most companies disagree.
